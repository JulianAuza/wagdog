Setting up your Reference Tables (Animals, Humans, Interests):

** NOTE: You should only need to do this ONCE, unless you have to drop your database and rebuild it. **

These instructions are modified from the ones here: http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/import-csv-file-into-posgresql-table/

** NOTE: These instructions also guide you through creating the table, but since we used CodeFirst table creation, we don't need those steps.
    Additionally, I skipped over the import by SQL query to the direct import through pgAdmin.  However, those import steps were written for an earlier version.  I've adjusted as needed below.

For each of the reference tables to import:
    1) In pgAdmin, navigate to that table, right click on the table name and select "Import/Export"
    2) At the top, make sure to change the toggle from "Export" to "Import"
    3) Copy the file path for the related csv file (right click on it in VSCode and select "Copy Path")
    4) Paste the file path in the field for "Filename"
    5) Make sure the format is csv (should be the default)
    6) In the "Miscellaneous section":
        - Switch "HEADER" to yes
        - Select the comma from the Delimiter options 
    7) Click "OK"
    8) Make sure everything worked by viewing all rows of the table! (If not, let me know and I'll troubleshoot)!
